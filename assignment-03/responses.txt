My responses:

1)	The world wide web is different than the internet because the internet is a fixed hierarchal system that is almost like a tree in which each thing branches off one another. It connects participants while the Web connects information. The world wide web holds all of the information that has been posted and stores it. On the original webpage you can look at how many people are on a website every second or how many people have been active since you’ve been on that page.
2)	The internet works by transmitting information from one computer to another. An IP address is a unique address that is given to every device and this is what ensures that the information sent to you is connected correctly. DNS Servers keeps track of the IP address that corresponds with the domain name. The information is sent through optical fiber cables that are placed by ships through the ocean. This connects thee signal but before it can reach your computer it must go through your server or router. However, on our smart phones, the signal is sent to a telephone tower and is transmitted to your phone. The information is sent through packets that break down the information into little pieces that are then reassembled once it gets to your device.
3)	Data travels on the internet in things called bytes. These bytes send information through a number sequence of 1’s and 0’s. The internet breaks down these large piece of information (e.g. photos) composed of bytes into smaller pieces called packets.  Packets is a set of information that travels from one computer to another, but these packets don’t always go the same route. The routers keep these packets moving. TCP manages the sending and receiving of all information and makes sure all the packets of your information are there before you get the information.
4)	IP addresses are simply the unique address of a specific device. The DNS or the Domain Name System to look up and translate the domain to its unique IP Address.
5)	A cookie is an id card that identifies you and is just a file stored on your computer.
6)	Protocol, domain name, path
