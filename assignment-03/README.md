# Assignment 03
## Amber Tatkenhorst

I decided to take this course because I have fulfilled most of my major requirements and wanted to try something that was different than what I normally choose to take. Although I have no intentions of any web design/ code being part of my career, it may someday come in handy. Even if it never comes to be something that I need, I enjoy learning new things.

Some things that I have learned already is how to even get onto GitHub and make README posts. I also have learned a lot about the internet that I had always taken for granted because our current generations have always had internet and no one ever talks about where it comes from or how it works. As much as I hate to admit it. I had no idea that the World Wide Web and the internet were not the same thing. I hope to learn as much as I can, but its a lot of new information all at once.
